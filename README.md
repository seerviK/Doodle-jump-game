🎮 Doodle Jump Game
Welcome to Doodle Jump, a browser-based arcade game where you guide a character to jump across platforms, climb higher, and aim for a high score! Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project brings a classic, addictive gameplay experience to the web. Ready to jump in? 🚀

📂 Project Structure
 - HTML/CSS: Sets up the game board, Doodler, and platforms with a responsive layout.
 - JavaScript: Manages the game mechanics, including player controls, physics, collision detection, and score management.
🕹️ Gameplay Overview
 - Objective: Keep your character jumping higher and avoid falling off the screen.
 - Score: Score points as you jump from platform to platform. Gravity will pull you down, so keep moving up!
 - Controls:
 - Arrow Right or D: Move right
 - Arrow Left or A: Move left
 - Space: Restart game (after Game Over)

💻 Code Highlights
The game dynamics are driven by JavaScript:
 - Physics: The character is subject to gravity and has a set initial jump velocity. Gravity affects the doodler's descent, and successful landings reset the jump.
 - Platform Generation: Platforms are generated at random horizontal positions to create a fresh, dynamic experience each time.
 - Collision Detection: Precise collision algorithms ensure smooth landings, allowing players to bounce upward accurately.
